excerpt: 'Dishonest acts such as corruption, fraud, and tax evasion reduce economic growth and social development. Traditional economics has studied the decision to engage in dishonesty through cost-benefit analysis. However, recent research has shown that this approach is limited, which is the reason why we choose to take a behavioral perspective to investigate dishonesty. Mainly, it seeks to analyze the relationship between dishonesty and social norms with university students. For this purpose, we carried out economic experiments in a laboratory setting. In the experiments, the core activity consisted of rolling a die twelve times and reporting each result obtained anonymously. To perform an intra-individual analysis, each subject is subjected to two rounds: a control and a treatment. At the beginning of the treatment rounds, information on the behavior of other participants was provided through messages that indicated the average gain in previous sessions. The students were divided into two experimental groups (A and B), according to the type of information they received. In the case of the first, it highlighted the honest behaviorsof the participants, while - for the second - the dishonest. Despite finding robust evidence of dishonesty at the group level, results do not show significant differences between the control round and the treatment round. However, it was found that gender and career are associated with higher levels of dishonesty, with women and economists reporting higher numbers compared to the other participants. For future research it is recommended to introduce a control group, as well as to increase the number of participants exposed to the different treatments. In the same way, it is proposed that future research design treatments that are easier to understand and that can be applied in different universities or other settings.'
